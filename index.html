        <p>Explorers needed the time to navigate at sea. The latitude could already be accurately determined on the basis of the stars, but for the longitude was the local time needed. If the clock was one minute wrong, that was already a deviation of 28 km in the tropics. So the origin of the watch stemmed from the need for a precise navigation tool.
             The history of the watch started with the so-called quadrans, a disc which could be determined on the basis of protractors what time it was. The first mechanical clocks which were accurate enough worked with a pendulum. This clock needed to hang quietly, so it was not suitable for sea or pocket.Then it happened at the beginning of the 16th century. The German Peter Henlein from Nuremberg made the first portable clock with a spring mechanism. This is seen as the first watch. People also called these watches the Nuremberg eggs, because of the oval enclosure. It was still an art to let the mechanical watch run accurately. The Swiss mechanics Jacob Zech and Gruet changed this with their innovation. They build a mechanism that provided great resistance when the spring was tightly wound
